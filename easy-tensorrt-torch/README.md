# easy-tensorrt-torch

## Instalation

1. Follow easy-tensorrt-sys README to install and prepare envs for CUDA and TensorRT.

2. Install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) with CUDA support. We support PyTorch 2.0 and above.

3. Choose easy_tensorrt_tch2x0 for your PyTorch version and follow the README to install. For example, if you are using PyTorch 2.0.x, you should install easy_tensorrt_tch200.

## Note

We only tested with PyTorch 2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8 on Linux, and PyTorch 2.7 and CUDA 12.8 on Windows. But it should work with other versions.

If there is any issue with other versions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
